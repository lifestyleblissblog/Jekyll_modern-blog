First off I have to start this post by saying I literally LOVE my 
neighbors!&nbsp;God blessed me with an amazing group of people and to 
top it off my next door neighbor is the sweetest and most fun party 
planner you will ever meet! She always gives me inspiration and I love 
working with her on parties. This year we decided to have a Glow in the 
dark Easter Egg Hunt to add to the list of neighborhood traditions. Yes 
it is as fun as it sounds! &nbsp;</p><p>Below I will share a little bit 
on our party,&nbsp;how we put it all together and what worked and didn’t
 work for us so you too can add this to your Easter Traditions!</p><p>HOW TO START&nbsp;</p><p>First
 things first you will want to plan to start the party when it gets 
dark(obviously) if you are doing it outside. We decided that waiting 
about 45 minutes after dusk was best to really be able to see all the 
eggs glowing at night. You could also do a party inside if you wanted to
 but would want to keep it small and on one level of your house.

### WHAT YOU WILL NEED

Fillable eggs ,LED lights, candies and little toys</p>

These things are a MUST have for a glow in the dark Easter Egg hunt.&nbsp;We 
found that the large fillable eggs worked best to be able to fit the 
light, candy and a little toy all together in one egg. We tried using 
glow in the dark sticks and LED'S to light up the eggs. The LED lights 
worked better by far. The small glow sticks sometimes cracked open when 
we were stuffing the eggs and just weren’t as bright. I'm sure tomorrow 
all my neighbors will be finding some eggs that the kids missed in their
 yards.</p><p>HOW TO GET THE EGGS TO GLOW</p><p>Once you have all your 
materials you will need to plan a time to stuff your eggs. We planned 
our Easter Egg Hunt for 8:05pm and all got together at 3pm to stuff the 
eggs because we were using some glow sticks and wanted to make sure the 
eggs were still glowing at 8pm. When using the LED light simply switch 
it on and pop it in the egg as you stuff it. If you decide to use glow 
sticks take the glow stick and snap it to make it glow – then give it a 
good shake to make sure it glows evenly the whole way through.

### THE EGG HUNT

 8pm we huddled all the kids up and had them put their hands in a circle
 like you would at a basketball game,&nbsp;chanted the neighhood name 
and sent them off running through the neighborhood collecting eggs.</p><p>I
 have to say the whole night was a hit. To be honest I'm not sure who 
had more fun the kids or the adults. It was a great celebration for the 
whole family!
